# Roadmap

I'll try to keep this up to date with planned changes and features. In addition to this roadmap the API itself will be regularly updated to improve validation and enforcement logic or simplify creating types.

* Integrate utilities, actions, conditions, and components from [TabletopTweaks](https://github.com/Vek17/WrathMods-TabletopTweaks)
    * Not including anything that requires patching or is specific to certain abilities
* Add support for multiple language localization
* Add utilities and tutorial for importing Unity assets
* Add more tutorials
    * Advanced Feat
    * Spell
    * Archetype
    * Class
* Expand utilities for types like ContextDurationValue and Evaluators
* Create high-level wrappers based on game mechanics
    * Example: SpellBuilder class or method which ensures the correct basic configuration when adding new spells
