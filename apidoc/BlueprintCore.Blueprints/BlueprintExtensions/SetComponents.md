# BlueprintExtensions.SetComponents method

Sets the blueprint's components to the provided list.

```csharp
public static void SetComponents(this BlueprintScriptableObject obj, 
    params BlueprintComponent[] components)
```

## Remarks

Modified from [TabletopTweaks ExtensionMethods](https://github.com/Vek17/WrathMods-TabletopTweaks).

This is the preferred way to update a blueprint's components; it ensures that each component has a unique name. This is important for proper serialization behavior.
