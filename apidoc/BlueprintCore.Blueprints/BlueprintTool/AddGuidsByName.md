# BlueprintTool.AddGuidsByName method (1 of 2)

Adds the provided mapping from Name to Guid.

```csharp
public static void AddGuidsByName(params (string name, string guid)[] guidsByName)
```

## Remarks

After calling this function you can reference blueprints by Name in BlueprintCore APIs.

If a Name has already been registered to a different Guid an exception is thrown. This could be an error in your mod or it could be a conflict with another mod. To prevent this from happening it is recommended to include an identifier unique to your mod. e.g. TabletopTweaks might prepend "TT": "TT-PowerAttackFeat".

Add a mapping for the Power Attack feat and check to see if the caster has it in a [`ConditionsCheckerbuilder`](../../BlueprintCore.Conditions.Builder/ConditionsCheckerBuilder.md):

```csharp
BlueprintTool.AddGuidsByName(("PowerAttackFeat", "9972f33f977fc724c838e59641b2fca5"));
var conditionsChecker = ConditionsCheckerBuilder.New().CasterHasFact("PowerAttackFeat").Build();
```
