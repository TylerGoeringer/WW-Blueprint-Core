# RuleTempModifierTooltips class

Fix to ensure temporary modifiers are displayed on tooltips.

```csharp
public static class RuleTempModifierTooltips
```

## Remarks

In the base game, temporary modifiers are removed from the rule modifiers before the tooltip is generated. This patches AllBonuses and concatenates any temporary modifiers. It works because the temporary modifiers are removed only from the rule modifiers, but are still stored in the rule as temporary modifiers.
