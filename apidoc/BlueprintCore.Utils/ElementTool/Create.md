# ElementTool.Create&lt;T&gt; method

Intantiates and initializes Element objects.

```csharp
public static T Create<T>()
    where T : Element
```

## Remarks

Internally this calls Type) which has some basic object init logic. If this init logic is not executed exceptions may be thrown when the object is referenced.

A few types that inherit from Element do not have a parameterless constructor. For those types use [`Init`](./Init.md).
