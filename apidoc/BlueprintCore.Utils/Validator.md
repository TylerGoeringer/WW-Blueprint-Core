# Validator class

Validates the configuration of objects.

```csharp
public static class Validator
```

## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| static [Check](Validator/Check.md)(…) | Checks the object and returns a list of validation warnings |

## Remarks

Any API implemented in BlueprintCore calls this for all relevant object types. If you instantiate objects outside of BlueprintCore you can call [`Check`](./Validator/Check.md) to get validation warnings.
