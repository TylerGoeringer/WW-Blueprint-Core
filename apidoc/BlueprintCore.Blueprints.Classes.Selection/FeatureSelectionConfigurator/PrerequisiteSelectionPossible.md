# FeatureSelectionConfigurator.PrerequisiteSelectionPossible method

Adds PrerequisiteSelectionPossible

```csharp
public FeatureSelectionConfigurator PrerequisiteSelectionPossible(GroupType group = GroupType.All, 
    bool checkInProgression = false, bool hideInUI = false)
```

## Remarks

A feature selection with this component only shows up if the character is eligible for at least one feature. This is useful when a character has access to different feature selections based on some criteria.

See ExpandedDefense and WildTalentBonusFeatAir3 blueprints for example usages.
