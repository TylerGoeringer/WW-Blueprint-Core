# ConditionsCheckerBuilder class

Fluent builder for ConditionsChecker

```csharp
public class ConditionsCheckerBuilder
```

## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| static [New](ConditionsCheckerBuilder/New.md)() |  |
| [Add](ConditionsCheckerBuilder/Add.md)(…) | Adds the specified Condition to the checker, with validation. |
| [Build](ConditionsCheckerBuilder/Build.md)() |  |
| [UseOr](ConditionsCheckerBuilder/UseOr.md)() | Causes the checker to return true if at least one conditions check passes. By default all checks must pass. |
| [Validate](ConditionsCheckerBuilder/Validate.md)(…) | Runs the object through [`Validator.Check()`](../BlueprintCore.Utils/Validator/Check.md), adding any errors to the validation warnings. |

## Remarks

Conditions are supported using extension methods. Include the extension namespaces as needed.

When [`Build`](./ConditionsCheckerBuilder/Build.md) is called the ConditionsChecker is constructed, validated, and returned. If any errors are detected by [`Validator`](../BlueprintCore.Utils/Validator.md) they will be logged as a warning.

Do not call [`Build`](./ConditionsCheckerBuilder/Build.md) twice on the same builder.

If a method calls for a string to represent any type of blueprint, you can pass the blueprint's AssetGuid as a string or as a name you already provided using [`AddGuidsByName()`](../BlueprintCore.Blueprints/BlueprintTool/AddGuidsByName.md).

**Extensions**

**AreaEx**

Conditions involving the game map, dungeons, or locations. See also KingdomEx for location related conditions specifically tied to the Kingdom and Crusade system.

**BasicEx**

Most game mechanics related conditions not included in [`ContextEx`](../BlueprintCore.Conditions.Builder.ContextEx/ConditionsCheckerBuilderContextEx.md).

**[`ContextEx`](../BlueprintCore.Conditions.Builder.ContextEx/ConditionsCheckerBuilderContextEx.md)**

Most ContextCondition types. Some ContextCondition types are in more specific extensions such as KingdomEx.

**KingdomEx**

Conditions involving the Kingdom and Crusade system.

**[`NewEx`](../BlueprintCore.Conditions.Builder.NewEx/ConditionsCheckerBuilderNewEx.md)**

Conditions defined in BlueprintCore and not available in the base game.

**StoryEx**

Conditions related to the story such as companion stories, quests, name changes, and etudes.

Make a melee attack if the target is in range:

```csharp
// Provides the MeleeAttack extension for ActionListBuilder
using BlueprintCore.Actions.Builder.ContextEx; 
// Provides the TargetInMeleeRange extension for ConditionsCheckerBuilder
using BlueprintCore.Conditions.Builder.NewEx;

var actionList =
    ActionListBuilder.New()
        .Conditional(
            ConditionsCheckerBuilder.New().TargetInMeleeRange(),
            ifTrue: ActionListBuilder.New().MeleeAttack())
        .build();
```
