# IsDemoralizeAction class

Checks to determine if a Demoralize is being executed.

```csharp
public class IsDemoralizeAction : Condition
```

## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [IsDemoralizeAction](IsDemoralizeAction/IsDemoralizeAction.md)() | The default constructor. |
| override [CheckCondition](IsDemoralizeAction/CheckCondition.md)() |  |
| override [GetConditionCaption](IsDemoralizeAction/GetConditionCaption.md)() |  |

## Remarks

There is no explicit trigger for demoralize. To trigger behavior when demoralize is used, use AddInitiatorSkillRollTrigger with StatType.CheckIntimidate and this condition.

Note that this will return false if the target is immune to Shaken, implying immunity to demoralize. However, shaken is implemented as both a UnitCondition and as a BlueprintBuff, so it's possible the target is immune to the buff and thus immune to demoralize.

This may be deprecated in the future if a better patch for Demoralize can expose a cleaner trigger API.
