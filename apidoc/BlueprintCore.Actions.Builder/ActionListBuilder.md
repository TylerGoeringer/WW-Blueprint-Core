# ActionListBuilder class

Fluent builder for ActionList.

```csharp
public class ActionListBuilder
```

## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| static [New](ActionListBuilder/New.md)() |  |
| [Add](ActionListBuilder/Add.md)(…) | Adds the specified GameAction to the list, with validation. |
| [Build](ActionListBuilder/Build.md)() |  |
| [Conditional](ActionListBuilder/Conditional.md)(…) | Adds Conditional |
| [Validate](ActionListBuilder/Validate.md)(…) | Runs the object through [`Validator.Check()`](../BlueprintCore.Utils/Validator/Check.md), adding any errors to the validation warnings. |

## Remarks

Actions are supported using extension methods. Include the extension namespaces as needed.

When [`Build`](./ActionListBuilder/Build.md) is called the ActionList is constructed, validated, and returned. If any errors are detected by [`Validator`](../BlueprintCore.Utils/Validator.md) they will be logged as a warning.

Do not call [`Build`](./ActionListBuilder/Build.md) twice on the same builder.

If a method calls for a string to represent any type of blueprint, you can pass the blueprint's AssetGuid as a string or as a name you already provided using [`AddGuidsByName()`](../BlueprintCore.Blueprints/BlueprintTool/AddGuidsByName.md).
