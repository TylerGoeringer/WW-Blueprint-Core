# BlueprintCore Tutorials

Tutorials explain how to modify the game using this library. They are a work in progress and more will be added.

Tutorial names indicate what type of modification to the game they explain. For example, [Adding a Feat](feat.md) explains how to use the library to create a new feat.

You can do them in any order but the recommended order is:

1. [Pre-work](#pre-work)
2. [Adding a Feat](feat.md)
3. Advanced Feats
    * [Skald's Vigor](advanced/skalds_vigor.md)
    * [Furious Focus](advanced/furious_focus.md)
    * [Hurtful](advanced/hurtful.md)

All tutorial code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/WW-Blueprint-Core/tree/main/BlueprintCoreTutorial). Each tutorial has a challenge not covered in the tutorial. One possible solution to each challenge is available in the `Solutions` folder.

Aside from that you can take a look at these mods built using BPCore:

* [CharacterOptions+](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/CharacterOptionsPlus)
* [Madison's Metagaming](https://github.com/madisoncfallin/MadisonsMetagaming)
* [Come and Get Me!](https://github.com/Envibel/ComeAndGetMe)

### Pre-work

* Install and configure [Unity Mod Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21)
* Complete the BlueprintCore [Project Setup](~/articles/intro.md)

Build your project to make sure everything is configured correctly. Now you're ready to start the tutorials.

Be sure to check [known issues](~/articles/usage/issues.md) if you run into any problems.
