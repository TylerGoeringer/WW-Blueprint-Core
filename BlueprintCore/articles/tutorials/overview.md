# BlueprintCore Tutorials

Tutorials explain how to modify the game using this library. They are a work in progress and more will be added.

Tutorial names indicate what type of modification to the game they explain. For example, [Adding a Feat](feat.md) explains how to use the library to create a new feat.

You can do them in any order but the recommended order is:

1. Pre-work
2. [Adding a Feat](feat.md)
3. WIP

All tutorial code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/WW-Blueprint-Core/tree/main/BlueprintCore%20Tutorial). Each tutorial has a challenge not covered in the tutorial. One possible solution to each challenge is available in the `Solutions` folder.

### Pre-work

Before going through any of these tutorials you should work through the [OwlcatModdingWiki Beginner Guide](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/OwlcatModdingWiki/wiki/Beginner-Guide). The tutorials require:

* A C# project configured for installation using [Unity Mod Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21)
* A [Public Assembly](https://github.com/WittleWolfie/OwlcatModdingWiki/wiki/Publicize-Assemblies)
    * Be sure to configure the `WrathPath` environment variable
* [Optional] Download [RemoteConsole](https://github.com/OwlcatOpenSource/RemoteConsole/releases)
    * This will show game log events making it easier to debug issues

Once that's done, complete the BlueprintCore [Project Setup](~/articles/intro.md).

Build your project to make sure everything is configured correctly. Now you're ready to start the tutorials.

Be sure to check [known issues](~/articles/issues.md) if you run into any problems.
